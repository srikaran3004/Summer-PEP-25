CAP Theorem-> Consistency, Avaliability, Partition Tolerance
PACELC-> When Partition Tolerance is there we need to choose between A and C , else we need to choose between Latency and Consistency (as until Consistency is attained user request will not get executed).

//While writing code make sure you follow these principles.
DRY-> Donot repeat yourself
Readability -> Code should be modular enough.

Read OSI model to better understand Loadbalancing -> Two types related to L4 and L7 ( Transport and Application layer)
Sticky request -> X request -> hash(X)%no.of servers =(index) 
X request goes to that index.
Consistent hashing.
